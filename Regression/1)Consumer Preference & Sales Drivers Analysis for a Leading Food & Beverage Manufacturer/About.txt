                           🎉Consumer Preference & Sales Drivers Analysis for a Leading Food & Beverage Manufacturer 📊

I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my first project! In this project, I developed a machine learning model to analyze consumer preference trends (themes) and identify the key drivers of sales for a major Food & Beverage manufacturer. The goal was to help the client understand consumer behavior and make data-driven decisions to boost their sales.

Here’s a quick overview of the steps I took for my project "Consumer Preference & Sales Drivers for Business Growth":

📊 Data Collection: Collected data from multiple sources, including client-provided sales data, social media mentions, Google search trends, and theme-product mappings.

🔍 Data Understanding: Explored the datasets with functions like head(), describe(), and info() to understand the structure and identify key variables.

🛠️ Data Preprocessing: Merged data from different sources, checked for missing values, handled data sparsity, and addressed anomalies in each dataset.

🔧 Feature Engineering: Created theme-level aggregations for sales, mapped products to themes and manufacturers, and calculated social and search trends for each theme.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed overall market share, identified top competitors for each theme, and explored trends and seasonality across themes using bar charts, time series analysis, and correlation heatmaps.

🏷️ Data Transformation: Performed appropriate transformations to create a dependent variable (sales at the theme level) and encoded categorical variables as needed.

📂 Modeling: Built a regression model to estimate the impact of social media trends, search trends, own price, and competitor actions on sales.

💻 Model Training and Validation: Trained and validated the model for the top 3 themes, using holdout validation to ensure model performance.

📊 Business Insights: Identified the controllable factors that could increase sales, with recommendations on how to achieve a 5% sales boost for specific themes.
