🚀 Unleashing the Power of Data Science: Predicting Credit Card Default Risks! 🚀

💳 Introducing My Second Project: Credit Card Default Prediction for Financial Institutions 🌐

🌐 Today marks a significant advancement in risk management as I unveil a comprehensive machine learning model designed to predict credit card default risks. Join me on this exciting journey toward smarter financial decisions!

🚀 Key Features:

✨ Robust Data Analysis:

Utilized a dataset comprising 30,000 credit card clients with 25 attributes, including features such as credit limit, demographic information, past payment behaviors, and the target variable indicating whether a client defaulted on their payments. Key features include:

LIMIT_BAL: Credit limit of the client.
AGE: Age of the client.
EDUCATION: Education level.
The default.payment.next.month variable indicates whether the client defaulted.

✨ In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilized visualization techniques to identify factors influencing default risks, including histograms, correlation heatmaps, and count plots.

✨ Feature Engineering Mastery:

Engineered features to enhance model accuracy, such as calculating the credit utilization ratio and summarizing payment behaviors.

✨ Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and ensured the dataset was suitable for modeling, including removing irrelevant columns and encoding categorical variables.

✨ Diverse Modeling Techniques:

Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Techniques like stratified sampling were used for a representative train-test split.

💼 Why This Matters:

🌟 Proactive Risk Management: Equip financial institutions to identify high-risk clients, enabling preventative measures to reduce default rates.

🌟 Data-Driven Decisions: Foster a culture of informed decision-making based on quantitative insights, enhancing profitability and customer retention.
